//! The Chain Allocation Committee seat lottery (SPEC §4.3).
//!
//! For every 10th PoW-Tx block B, the new member is the ID at position
//! `SHA256("GB/cac" ‖ hash of block B+k) mod N_active` of the canonical active list; a draw
//! that lands on a member moves to the next position, wrapping around. The new member is
//! drawn before the oldest leaves. A banned or deactivated member leaves at once, and an extra
//! draw fills its seat at the next 10th block, at `SHA256("GB/cac" ‖ hash ‖ i)` with
//! `i = 1, 2, …` \[P\].
