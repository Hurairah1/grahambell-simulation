# Architecture — GrahamBell Stage 1

This document describes how the Stage 1 code is organised, how later milestones plug in, how the protocol core will be shared with the Stage 3 testnet, and how releases move from the private repository to the public one. It is a design document: crates marked *planned* below do not exist yet.

`docs/SPEC.md` is the source of truth for protocol rules. Nothing in this document changes a rule. The allocation algorithm in the last section began as a proposal; the architect adopted it on 2026-10-06 as SPEC §4.2 [D], and the section now records its rationale.

## 1. Goals and constraints

- **Reproducible.** One master seed, a recorded configuration and a recorded git commit fully determine every output (SPEC §11.4). Reruns are checked byte for byte through a SHA-256 manifest.
- **Ground truth first.** Every quantity with a closed form is computed exactly in M1. The simulators must match those values before their other results are trusted (SPEC §11.3).
- **Two tiers** (SPEC §11.1):
  - Tier 1 simulates protocol messages at reduced scale.
  - Tier 2 models millions of participants statistically, and is validated against Tier 1 where their scales overlap.
- **One protocol core.** The rules a simulator enforces are the same code the Stage 3 testnet runs (SPEC §11.7).
- **Configurable everything.** Every SPEC number is a typed parameter with its status tag and sweep (`gb-config`).

## 2. Crate map

| Crate | Status | Milestone | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gb-config` | exists | M0 | Typed parameters for every SPEC §2 row (value, status D/P/O, sweep), M1 grids, run settings; TOML loading by deep merge over defaults. |
| `gb-runlog` | exists | M0 | Run id, git commit and dirty flag, UTC timestamp, resolved-config hash, SHA-256 manifest of outputs, seeded ChaCha20 streams. |
| `gb-analytic` | exists | M1 | Exact closed forms and exact probabilities (sections A–I), with independent cross-checks. Pure functions; no I/O. |
| `gb-cli` | exists | M0+ | Binary `gb`: loads config, runs analyses, writes CSV/PNG/SUMMARY, the public brief and the run log. Front end only; never recomputes results. |
| `gb-protocol` | planned | M2 | Shared protocol core, listed in section 5. |
| `gb-crypto-tests` | planned | M2 | Micro-tests with real SHA-256 and BLS12-381: S11 grinding, S14, proof of possession, equivocation, and equivalence tests for any abstraction a simulator uses. |
| `gb-sim` | planned | M3, M4 | Tier 1 discrete-event simulator. |
| `gb-scale` | planned | M6 | Tier 2 aggregate model at full scale. |
| `gb-bench` | planned | M5 | S27 hardware benchmark and S28 money-cost model. |

Dependencies point one way: `gb-cli` → analysis crates (`gb-analytic`, `gb-sim`, `gb-scale`, `gb-bench`) → `gb-protocol`, `gb-config`, `gb-runlog`. No analysis crate depends on `gb-cli`.

## 3. The two tiers

### Tier 1 — `gb-sim` (protocol-level discrete-event simulation)

- **Event engine:** a priority queue of timestamped events with a deterministic tie order (time, then event sequence number).
- **Actors:** unregistered miners (/64s), registered IDs acting as witness nodes and miners, KWC proposers, and the CAC.
- **Network:** messages with regional latency distributions, loss, partitions and per-node rate limits.
- **Clocks:** per-node clocks with configurable skew, so δ-tolerance rules can be tested (S12).
- **Churn and adversaries:** household downtime profiles (H7), botnet churn (S4), and attacker strategies as pluggable policies (restart, hopping, stalling, griefing, eclipsing).
- **Cryptography:** real `gb-protocol` code where affordable. Where a statistically equivalent abstraction is used for speed, M2 must first document and test the equivalence.
- **Scale:** up to about 100,000 miners.
- **Milestones:**
  - M3 covers issuance scenarios S1–S10, including S5 restart, S6 difficulty hopping and S7 adaptive issuance.
  - M4 covers the witness layer, S12–S26.

### Tier 2 — `gb-scale` (aggregate model)

- Represents populations by counts and distributions instead of individual messages: issuance shares, KWC compositions, committee compositions, attrition.
- Uses M1 closed forms wherever they are exact. Stochastic components are calibrated against Tier 1.
- **Validated against Tier 1** on overlapping scales (10³ to 10⁵ miners) before results are reported at millions (M6).

## 4. Validation ladder

Each M1 table becomes a check that a later simulator must pass.

| M1 output | Later check |
|---|---|
| A1–A3, A7 time to threshold, long-run share | M3 issuance simulator (S2, S3) within its confidence interval; H2 within ±5% |
| A4 adaptive cap (checkpoints, worst phase, safety factor k = 7/6) | M3 S7 |
| A6 genesis to issue | M3/M6 with household downtime profiles |
| B1–B3 per-KWC capture/stall probabilities | M4 allocation simulation (S15) at the same p and network sizes |
| B4 distinct episodes and compositions over 10 years (adopted allocation, bans) | M4 count of distinct episodes, with compositions and the one-seat entry ratio |
| B5 the seat rule (v0.3 against v0.4 at each L) under illustrative absences | M4 with M3 household downtime profiles |
| C1–C2 committee stall/capture, entries per year, episode lengths (seat lottery) | M4 S21 with the real next-position rule and registration-order layouts |
| C3 committee departures (Little's law share) | M4 S21 simulating departures and extra draws |
| D1 restart advantage, including the realistic cost of 450 s | M3 S5 (H4) |
| E1 difficulty-hopping gain against the Variant A comparison | M3 S6 (H5), with Variant B's correction once proposed |
| F1 same-step tie rate | M3 fork/orphan rate |
| G1–G3 quorum trade-off (stall, sign alone, conflicting approvals) | M4 S15–S21 under whichever quorums the architect chooses; conflicting approvals also need the proposer rules |
| G4 ten-year episodes under each seat rule | M4 with M3 household downtime profiles |
| H1–H3 quorum feasibility under honest downtime, minimum uptime, absent seats per L | M3 household profiles (H7), M4 with the forced-signing and ban rules (§4.5–§4.6) |
| I1–I4 KWC size trade-off: security, liveness, load, on-demand connections | M2 threshold BLS key setup at each size, M4, M5 household limits (router tables, upload) |

**[P] proposals recorded in SPEC v0.4 §12 and where they are tested:**

- separate PoWit validity from payment (any 27 of 40 is valid; an unsigned leader member's share is never generated): M4 against 7 + 21, on liveness (H), leaders' incentives and issuance per block;
- the split rule, a lower PoWit-only quorum: M4 (G2 maps it);
- larger KWCs: M2 and M5 (I maps them);
- threshold BLS entropy: M2 measures the key-setup cost;
- witness peer topology option 2 (no standing witness-to-witness connections): M3 and M5 (I4 estimates the on-demand connections).

## 5. `gb-protocol` and the Stage 3 testnet

`gb-protocol` holds protocol rules as pure, deterministic functions with no networking, storage or clock access:

- **§3.3 headers:** fixed-length encodings and domain tags.
- **§3.4 entropy lock:** miner signature, member signatures, BLS aggregate (via `blst`), and `E = SHA256("GB/entropy-out" ‖ aggregate ‖ bitfield)`.
- **§3.5 hash chain:** `h_n`, start rule (a), and rule (b) for S13.
- **§3.6 witness signing condition** and **§3.7 validation:** quorum with bitfield and proof of possession, full chain recomputation, timestamp rules, the same-height tie-break, uniqueness.
- **§3.8 difficulty** Variant B (default) and the Variant A comparison, and **§3.9 issuance** (fixed; adaptive with the checkpointed cap and its safety factor).
- **§3.11 registration index** and the canonical active list.
- **§4.2 allocation** (section 8), with the v0.4 seat rule, and the **§4.3 seat lottery** with its extra draws, all recomputed by every node from chain data.

**Sharing.** `gb-sim` calls these functions directly, and so will the Stage 3 node. M2 produces test vectors (inputs and expected hashes, signatures and validation verdicts) that both the simulator and the testnet node must reproduce. A rule change therefore lands in one place and is caught by the vectors everywhere.

**Versioning.** `gb-protocol` carries a protocol version. Simulator outputs record it next to the git commit.

## 6. Determinism and outputs

- **Randomness:** one master seed. Each component draws from `rng_stream(seed, label)`, a ChaCha20 stream seeded by `SHA-256(seed ‖ label)`. Samplers (uniform, geometric, exponential) are written in-repo, so outputs do not depend on another crate's sampling algorithms.
- **Arithmetic:**
  - Exact rationals for tail probabilities.
  - `libm` (pure Rust) for transcendental functions, so results do not depend on the platform math library.
  - No hash-map iteration in output paths.
- **Parallelism** (Tier 2) uses deterministic partitioning and ordered reductions only.
- **Run directory:** `results/<analysis>/<run-id>/` holds the tables (CSV), charts (PNG), `SUMMARY.md`, `config.resolved.toml` and `run.json`. `run.json` records commit, dirty flag, seed, config hash, toolchain and a SHA-256 for every output file.
- **Front ends** read these outputs only (SPEC §11.6).

## 7. Configuration toggles to add with M3/M4

These [P] rules and comparisons are defined in the SPEC but not needed by M1. They will become typed `gb-config` parameters when the simulators use them:

- mandatory handshake vs none (§3.1, S26);
- hash-priority tie-break for pending claims vs timestamps (§3.1);
- sorted-hash field ordering (S14);
- "unreachable is not refusal" vs strict One Chance (§4.6, S17);
- diversity constraints in allocation (§4.2);
- proposer rotation, proposer rights and failure behaviour (§4.4);
- Variant B's correction from recent block times (§3.8), once proposed;
- the SPEC v0.4 §12 [P] proposals: validity separate from payment, the split rule, larger KWCs, threshold BLS entropy and witness peer topology option 2.

The lottery beacon offset k, the allocation beacon delay and the long-absence threshold L are already typed parameters (all [O]). M1 does not depend on the two beacon parameters, because it models the draws as uniform; M2 and M4 measure what the miner of a beacon block can gain by withholding it. L enters sections B, G and H through its sweep.

## 8. Allocation — adopted as SPEC §4.2 [D]

The architect adopted this algorithm on 2026-10-06 (SPEC v0.3 §4.2, with the registration index of §3.11) and amended its removal rule on 2026-10-07 (SPEC v0.4 §4.7). The SPEC states the rule; this section keeps the reasoning behind it.

SPEC §4.2 requires allocation to be deterministic and publicly recomputable, with placement unknown to an ID's owner at minting time. SPEC §2 requires:

- every WC to have exactly 10 members;
- each WC to lead exactly one KWC and be a subordinate in exactly three;
- no mutual monitoring pairs.

The earlier SPEC gave no algorithm that met all of these at once. Because the inside-out shuffle keeps every assignment uniformly random, M1's uniform-partition model of seats remains exact under the adopted rule.

### 8.1 Seats: inside-out Fisher–Yates insertion

1. IDs are allocated in canonical order: the registration index of SPEC §3.11, which follows PoW-ID confirmation order. Genesis IDs are allocated first, using a public launch seed in place of a beacon.
2. **Seats.** Seats are numbered 0, 1, 2, …, and WC `w` is seats `10w` to `10w + 9`.
3. **Inserting an ID.** When an ID is inserted while `n` seats are filled, compute `j = SHA256("GB/alloc" ‖ ID ‖ beacon) mod (n + 1)`, reading the hash as a 256-bit integer; the modulo bias is below 2⁻²⁰⁰. Without removals, `n` is the ID's registration index. The beacon is the hash of the PoW-ID block 6 blocks after the ID's confirmation (SPEC §2, [O]).
   - If `j = n`, the ID takes seat `n`.
   - Otherwise the ID in seat `j` moves to seat `n`, and the new ID takes seat `j`.
4. **Why it is uniform.** This is the inside-out Fisher–Yates shuffle. After every step, the assignment of allocated IDs to seats is a uniformly random permutation, given uniform hash outputs.
5. **Active and pending WCs.** A WC is active when all 10 of its seats are filled, so the number of active WCs is `W = ⌊allocated / 10⌋`. The partial tail WC is pending. Its members may mine (§3.10) but do not witness until it fills, about 5 minutes at 30 s per ID.
6. **Removals** (a ban, or a continuous absence longer than the long-absence threshold L; SPEC v0.4 §4.7). The ID in the last filled seat moves into the vacated seat. If that empties a seat of the last active WC, that WC returns to pending, `W` decreases by one, and the KWC ring (8.2) is recomputed. Going offline or being deactivated does not move anyone: the absent ID keeps its seat as an offline member. A returning ID whose seat was vacated is re-inserted by step 3, with the beacon of the block 6 blocks after its re-activation is confirmed (architect, 2026-10-07).
7. **When placement takes effect.** At the ID's beacon block, without waiting for the Allocation Committee Block, which records and attests it (SPEC v0.4 §4.2–§4.3).

### 8.2 KWCs: a Golomb-ruler ring

For `W ≥ 13` active WCs, KWC `w` has leader WC `w` and subordinate WCs `(w + 1)`, `(w + 4)` and `(w + 6)`, all mod `W`.

- **Each WC leads exactly one KWC and is a subordinate in exactly three:** the KWCs led by `w − 1`, `w − 4` and `w − 6`.
- **No mutual monitoring pairs.** WC `j` monitors WC `i` exactly when `(j − i) mod W ∈ {1, 4, 6}`. A mutual pair would need `d₁ + d₂ ≡ 0 (mod W)` for some `d₁, d₂ ∈ {1, 4, 6}`, but every such sum is at most 12, which is less than `W`.
- **Any two KWCs share at most one WC.** `{0, 1, 4, 6}` is a Golomb ruler: its 12 nonzero pairwise differences, ±1 to ±6, are distinct mod `W` for `W ≥ 13`. So each KWC overlaps exactly 12 others, each in one WC. That is the overlap degree M1 uses for its structure-free bound.
- **30-node comparison.** Use marks `{0, 1, 3}`, so subordinates are `(w + 1)` and `(w + 3)`, and `W ≥ 7`.

Everything depends only on chain data: the ID order, the beacons and the removal record. Anyone can recompute it. The CAC attests a hash of the resulting assignment but cannot choose it.

Other sizes use other optimal Golomb rulers (M1 section I): {1, 3} for 3 WCs, {1, 4, 9, 11} for 5, {1, 4, 10, 12, 17} for 6, {1, 4, 9, 15, 22, 32, 34} for 8 and {1, 6, 10, 23, 26, 34, 41, 53, 55} for 10.

### 8.3 What it replaced

- **§4.2 formula.** SPEC v0.2 wrote placement as a pure per-ID function, `chain(ID) = f(SHA256(ID ‖ beacon))`. Under the adopted rule, placement also depends on earlier allocations, and an existing ID moves when a new ID displaces it.
- **Fixed-membership principle.** The earlier principle was that chain membership stays fixed unless someone is banned. The adopted rule gives it up: every new ID changes the membership of one existing WC, and moves one existing ID into the pending tail WC.

### 8.4 Security reason for the change

The alternative that keeps membership fixed is **append-only** allocation: new IDs fill new WCs in arrival order, and existing WCs never change. Under append-only allocation, a new WC's composition mirrors the attacker's share of **recent issuance** (s), not its share of the **population** (p).

- An attacker pays to sustain issuance share at the margin. Early in an attack, s is far above p.
- In any ring layout, a new WC's KWC neighbours are also recent WCs. So a whole new KWC reflects s.
- **Example.** An attacker winning 60% of recent issuance holds at least 7 of 10 seats in about 38% of new WCs (P[Bin(10, 0.6) ≥ 7] = 0.382). Under uniform allocation with a 10% population share, the same event has probability about 9 × 10⁻⁶.

Insertion keeps every WC's composition at the population share, so the section B probabilities apply to new KWCs too.

### 8.5 Cost: composition changes

- **Seat changes:** each new ID changes one existing WC, and so 4 KWC compositions (a WC sits in 4 KWCs). That is 40 per new WC.
- **Ring relinks:** each new active WC adds its own KWC and relinks the 6 KWCs whose subordinate offsets wrap around the ring. That is 7 per new WC.
- **Total:** about 47 composition changes per new WC (4.7 per new ID), against 1 for append-only. A removal changes about 4.6, so an absence that vacates a seat and ends in a re-insertion changes about 9.3.
- **Effect on the H6 count:** counting every composition as an independent draw, the adopted rule raises the count about 43-fold over ten years from 100,000 KWCs (section B4). Most changed compositions differ from their predecessor by one seat, so the changes are correlated: at p = 25% a one-seat change enters the sign-capable state with about 0.43 to 0.46 times the probability of a fresh draw. Since SPEC v0.4 the primary measure is the number of distinct episodes, which is about half the composition count at p = 25% (0.476 against 0.926 for the unregistered quorum).
- **Effect of the v0.4 seat rule:** under v0.3 every absence that deactivated an ID cost about 9.3 compositions. Under v0.4 only absences longer than L do; with the illustrative inputs (4 absences per ID per year, Lomax durations) that leaves 3.6% of the v0.3 count at L = 30 days (section B5). The price is liveness: absent IDs keep their seats, which needs more honest uptime (section H).

### 8.6 Open risks

- **Beacon withholding.** The miner of the beacon block can withhold it to re-roll placements, at the cost of that block.
- **Placement grinding.** An unregistered miner cannot choose its ID hash freely, because the ID is the hash of the winning PoW-ID block and §3.4 allows one header per round. The residual freedom should still be measured in M2.

## 9. Release workflow (private → public)

Development and publication use two repositories.

| Remote | Repository | Pushing |
|---|---|---|
| `origin` | the private development repository | the default: all work, CI runs and reviews happen here |
| `public` | `github.com/Hurairah1/grahambell-simulation` | disabled: its push URL is set to `DISABLED` (`git remote set-url --push public DISABLED`), so a plain push can never reach it |

- **Day to day:** commits are pushed to `origin` only; `main` tracks `origin/main`.
- **Release:** only when the architect writes the exact words "push to public":
  1. restore the push URL: `git remote set-url --push public https://github.com/Hurairah1/grahambell-simulation.git`;
  2. push `main` only, with `git push public main`: never another branch, never `--force`;
  3. disable it again with `git remote set-url --push public DISABLED`, and check with `git remote -v`.
- **Reference results:** `results/` is ignored by git except a release's reference run in `results/analytic/reference/`. It is produced by `gb analytic` from a clean commit, and its `run.json` records that commit and a SHA-256 of every file, so anyone can check out the commit, rerun the analysis and compare.
- **Before a release push**, check the commit authors (`git log --format='%an <%ae>' | sort -u`), files over 1 MB, and anything that looks like a secret, a key or a local path.
